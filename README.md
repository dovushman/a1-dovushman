This project shows the first website I created for Webware. To create it, I forked from the original repo and worked in an HTML, CSS, Javascript file, and the server file.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added rules for most of the tags I used in this project, the tags with corresponding css are "article", "centered-list", "ul", "li", "div", "p", "body", "h1", "h2", "table", "th", "td", "button", and "img". In my css, I used many style rules including:
	- Color
 	- Text-align
	- Display
	- Padding
	- Background-color
	- Font-family
	- Border
  	- Margin
	- Margin-left
  	- Margin-right
  	- Font-weight
  	- Height
  	- Width
  	- Justify-content
  	- List-style-type
  	- Position
  	- Left
  	- Top

- While none of these tags were necessarily hard, at times, finding the tag I needed and adjusting it to fit my screen was challenging. For example, finding appropriate heights, widths, and margins was something I had to figure out per piece. On the other hand, using colors was easy since I had a color palette, and the color tag was easy to use.
 
- **JavaScript Animation**: In this project, I included a simple JavaScript animation that when a button is pressed, a png of a stick figure moves to the right side of the screen. This was the most challenging part of the project for me since I have never had to code an animation before. Figuring out how to have something move in real-time instead of appearing at a new place was an interesting challenge.

- **Semantic HTML Tags**: For this project, I included semantic tags in ways that I thought would help organize my page and add allow for a more interactive website. The tags I used included:
	- Href
  	- Img
	- Table
	- Footer
	- Article

- Most of these tags gave me no problems, but figuring out the table was the largest challenge. While it wasn't hard to use, the way you entered data into the table went against my intuition.

## Design Achievements
- **Adobe Color Palette**: Using Adobe, I created a color palette for my website. Since blue is my favorite color, I selected blue as my base color and let Adobe find other shades to go with it. Using CSS, I was able to implement all of the shades.
- **Used the Audiowide Font from Google Fonts**: I used Audiowide as the font for the h1 tag on my webpage.
